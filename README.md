## SJ Evenden Design 
I wanted to design and build a personal website/portfolio, which could showcase my design and coding abilities. I also wanted to provide information on projects I have worked on in the past. Furthermore, I  wanted to include the skills I can bring to a project. When considering the website's design, I liked the design to be clean and minimal, so I decided to focus on using good images, icons and minimal text. The design incorporates white space to help direct the user's focus to the sites most critical parts. I wanted the site to be easy to use and opted to design a one-page layout, making it easier to navigate a mobile device. 

## Demo
A live demo can be found at https://sje-1.github.io/sj-evenden-design/
## UX
The website focuses on potential employers, job agencies and other creatives interested in reviewing my skills/projects. 
Typically, people do not like to have to scroll through a website searching for information. Therefore, I felt that by having a call to action button, bringing people to the portfolio and contact sections could improve user experience. White space was used to ensure that the site's content was legible, while also enabling the user to focus on the text's elements. 

#### Wireframe
The wireframe below was used to as a tool to design and also bring style elements to the website.  The wireframe was also used to test how a user may journey through their online experience.

#### User Stories

1.	As a user,  I want to find the persons portfolio, so I placed a CTA at the top of the page to ensure students could navigate this section straight away.
2.	As a user, I want to get in touch; therefore, a contact form is incorporated in the site allowing users to reach out with any questions or queries. 

#### User Testing 
This website was tested using developer tools and user testing. I enlisted two users to help and asked them to find the sites portfolio and contact areas. One person carried out the test on a desktop and the other person on a mobile device. The users could both carry out these tests without any issues.

## Features
-   Skills section, which provides a list of skills I can bring to a project or     job
-   Portfolio section, which provides some examples of projects I have worked       on. This will be added too as I progress through the course
-   Education section, which provides my academic achievements
-   Contact section, allowing users to contact me with any queries 
-	Hamburger bar when the device is in mobile view 
-	Navigation bar is fixed, so navigation is accessible at all stages of the       user journey. 
-	Form – allows users to send a contact form/query by filling out their           contact details along with a message


## Features Left to Implement
-	Include a link to a downloadable CV
-	Include examples of websites that I have built – I can include these as the     course continues
-	Include examples of my UX process and projects that I have worked on
-	Include more examples of my music production skills 

## Technologies Used
This project was implemented using mostly Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. For the burger menu a script was added to ensure that the dropdown menu would be activated when used on a smaller screen.
-	Bootstrap
-	HTML
-	CSS 
-	JQuery
-	Popper

## Testing
The website was tested using responsive devices developer tools on google chrome. The website was tested across the following web browsers
- Safari 
- Chrome
- Firefox

The website was also tested on an Apple 6 smartphone, MOTO smartphone,  Apple MacBook pro, DELL and HP desktop computers. The website behaved as it should through all devices. 

I enlisted two users to help and asked them to find the sites portfolio and contact areas. One person carried out the test on a desktop and the other person on a mobile device. The users could both carry out these tests without any issues.

#### Code Validation
The HTML code was validated using the W3C Mark-up Validation Service. 
The CSS code was validated using Jigsaw CSS Validator.

Below is an example of how the website looks on two different browsers and at two different sizes. The website is performing well across all platforms.
